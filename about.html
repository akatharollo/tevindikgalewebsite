                    <h1>GET TO KNOW TEVIN</h1>
                    <p>I am obsessed with emerging businessses that have a potential to thrive in South Africa and I want to get it out there to the world.</p>
                    <p>It all began in 2010. I was 14 years old in grade 8 and my father had just bought a laptop. Little did they know that I was burning with curiosity. I remember the excitement I had when I first connected to the internet. I went to the shops to buy an airtime voucher of R5, and when I came back I used a dial up connection with a cellphone to connect the laptop to the internet. I was only able to land on the google search page, until the airtime ran out <b>(Laughable I know)</b> but I remember the excitement I had in that moment. It's as if I knew the possibilities that would come with the internet - deep down I knew - that I wanted to work in this exciting online world.  </p>
                    <p>I never stopped asking questions like "How does this work", "What if", "How Might I". This was cemented in me when I was doing my first year. Way before we could cover the <b>HTML & CSS </b>syllabus in class, I had a curiosity of how websites worked. So I went on Udemy and enrolled in a web development course during the first semester. When the second semester came along and we were given a task to make a webpage, it came as an easy task for me compared to my groupmates. That is when I realized the importance of self-research - that I learn better with practical tasks.
                    As a result, most of my hard skills are a product of going through that research, these includes: <b>Website development, Cloud Computing, React Native, UI/UX Design, Graphic Design, Data Analysis and Visualization</b>.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="about-col">
                    <p>Now, I am passionate about showing new business owners just how easy it is to get their business online and show them the immense joy and freedom the online world gives them! I see South Africa and the whole of the African continent as an utopia of future multi-million/billion businesses and tech as being the driving force to make this potential a success. So my biggest <b>WHY?</b> Is to use the skills that I have acquired to create platforms that will help creatives, bunisess owners, youth to get their ideas and products out there. </p>
